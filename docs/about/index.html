    <p>SKYLINE TECHNOLOGY GROUP delivers the best gaming experience period, but what does that mean? It means the best parts and technology the computer gaming industry has to offer. It means world class support from day one and SKYLINE's TECHNOLOGY GROUP support never ends. It means having a team of people who understand the art of elite system building and maintenance, standing by to assist you when you need it. It means never having to feel you made the wrong choice.

        Any company can build a PC, but few can build a custom gaming PC worthy of playing the latest games. Many claim to offer gaming PCs, but they don't deliver a complete gaming experience. A real gaming PC must be focused on Customization, Service, Gaming, and Technology. This is SKYLINE's Group specialty.
